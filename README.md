## Gacha Opener

With Patch 93, we got the automatic box opener included in the client, the problem is, it is too slow, taking up to hours if you have to open a large amount of boxes and it gets worst the higher ping you have.

This module changes the delay for each gacha try. The minimum delay is 0 but the effective minimum delay is twice your ping, because the module waits for the response from server to open another box.
